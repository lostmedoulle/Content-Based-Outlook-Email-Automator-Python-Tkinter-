Project Title: Outlook Automation with PDF Text Extraction with and without OCR
Automation of Email Processing in Outlook: Extracting Text from PDF Attachments with and without OCR

Motivation
This project addresses the challenge of managing large volumes of emails with PDF attachments in professional environments, such as legal, academic, or corporate settings. Manually sorting and classifying these emails can be time-consuming and error-prone. This script automates the process of reading emails, extracting text from PDF attachments, and organizing emails into specified folders based on the content of the attachments. It significantly reduces manual work and improves efficiency by using text extraction through Optical Character Recognition (OCR) when necessary.

Method and Results
The script uses Microsoftâ€™s Outlook API through the win32com.client library to access and manipulate emails. For PDF attachments, it first attempts to extract text using PyPDF2, a Python library capable of directly reading text from PDFs that are not image-based. If PyPDF2 fails to extract text (common with scanned documents), the script then uses EasyOCR, an OCR tool capable of interpreting text from images.
